# Project-2
# 🌍 Climate Change Modelling Project

This project presents an in-depth analysis and forecasting of climate change trends using historical climate datasets. The focus is on identifying temperature variations, modeling future scenarios, and visualizing the potential impact of climate change over time.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To model and analyze global climate trends, particularly temperature anomalies and other climate indicators, and forecast future scenarios using predictive analytics. The project aims to support climate awareness and policy-level decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- **Source**: NASA GISS Surface Temperature Analysis (GISTEMP) 
- **Key Columns**:
  - Year / Month
  - Global Average Temperature
  - Temperature Uncertainty
  - Region / Hemisphere (if applicable)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook)**
  - Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Prophet/ARIMA for forecasting
- **Power BI ** *(for dashboard visualization)*
- **Excel** *(for preliminary data cleaning and exploration)*

---

## 📌 Key Features

- 📈 Time-series analysis of global average temperatures
- 🔮 Forecasting climate trends (e.g., “What if warming accelerates?” scenarios)
- 🌡 Heatmap visualizations to show year-over-year changes
- 📊 Interactive dashboards to explore patterns and impacts
- ⚙ Data preprocessing and handling missing values

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
